Idea 1:

## BackGround
Natural Language Inference Tasks have these datasets:
- SNLI
- SICK
- Quora Question Pairs
- SciTail
- IMDB Sentiment
- MultiNLI


## Areas for improvement: 
1.  SICK DATA SET : transfered learning from SNLI MultiNI 59.1
1.  Quora Data: 89.94 (interaction space) (graded on loss)

## Goals
Improve these accuracy


## Techniques to use
1. Deep contextualized Word Representations
2. Interaction Space
3. Transfered learning with SciTail

## sources to look into
SemEval-2018 Task Semantic Textual Similarity Evaluation
